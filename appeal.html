            <p class="text-block">I am Pooja Rai from IIT Kharagpur, writing to all the IIT Alums on behalf of my team selected to the semi-finals of the Hult Prize 2015.</p>
            <p class="text-block">
              We are a team of five students from IIT Kharagpur who have been working towards social causes in our own different ways. The Hult prize in partnership with the Clinton Global Initiative provided us with the perfect opportunity to come together and create a sustainable solution to early childhood education in urban slums.We won the quarter-finals from among 45 teams and will be representing IIT Kharagpur in the semi-finals at San Francisco in March 2015. We are also the only team from India selected for semi-finals at San Francisco.
However, being students we don't have enough money to expend on the travel and we don't want to miss this golden opportunity to contribute to the roots of the problems across the world. Hence we are in need of funding for our travel and living expenses.
            </p>
            <p class="text-block">
              HULT prize is the Mecca of social entrepreneurs, hosted by the Hult International Business School in partnership with President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative.
              It has been named as one of the top five ideas changing the world by President Bill Clinton and TIME Magazine.
              he event hosted for the HULT prize finals is attended by over 3,000 members which include current and former heads of state, chief executives of corporations, philanthropists, thought leaders, prominent members of the media, and directors of nonprofit organizations.
            </p>
            <p class="text-block">
               The winning teams pitch their ideas at the annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting, where President Clinton, along with CGI Meeting attendees select and award the winning team with a USD 1 million prize.
               Since 2005, CGI Annual Meetings have brought together nearly 150 current and former heads of state, 18 Nobel Prizelaureates, hundreds of leading CEOs, heads of foundations, major philanthropists, directors of the most effective nongovernmental organizations, and prominent members of the media.

                      From our experiences and efforts, we have been exposed to the scenario in urban slums and we understand the challenges and complexities of life and its necessities therein.</p>

                Moreover we have been a part of a global multicultural non-profit called Share, which shares insights on the complexities of regional economies. We have also experience working with coorporations like Google and Firefox.

              At some point in life we all have thought of giving back to the underprivileged society.
              But with our tight schedules the right high impact opportunities that can create a difference are really few.
              A serendipitous convergence of such an opportunity with the will to give back gives the perfect embodiment of true satisfaction.
              The problem statement of HultPrize 2015 on Early childhood education in Urban Slums is a very essential one which even caters to
              providing basic education to the children of urban slum population living in India.
              This can be the perfect opportunity to give back to the community with young guns ready to take on the challenge to address the issue.

            <p class="text-block">
              The first step in the gregarious task is attending the finals at San Francisco.
              For that we need travel assistance from Kolkata(India) to San Francisco(USA) and logistics arrangements for the five members in San francisco,
              all of which is equivalent to funding of around INR 7,50,000 (i.e. travel and living expenses of approx. INR 1,50,000/person )
              to cover our expenses for the same. We would be providing all the invoices for the same.
              For us as students, this is a wonderful opportunity and we request the IIT Alums to help us
              in any form possible so that the solutions to the education problem reach out to the right people and
              we are able to carry on the torch of the IIT Brand forward as all of you have done successfully.
